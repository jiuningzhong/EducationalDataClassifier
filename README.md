# Educational Data Classifier

This project is intended to be a walkthrough on the development of a machine learning project **from end to end**. It covers the creation a real-time web application that gathers data from educational sources and shows a summary of the different topics that are being treated.

This is achieved with a **supervised machine learning classification** model that is able to predict the complexity level of a given educational node, and an **interactive web application** that shows the obtained results to the user.

The web application can be used at https://www.heroku.com/. Please consider that a live web-scraping process is carried out every time you run the app, so there may be some crashes due to the failing status of some requests.

The full detailed process is explained in the [Report](https://github.com/jiuningzhong/EducationalDataClassifier/blob/master/0.%20Latest%20News%20Classifier/09.%20Report/Latest%20News%20Classifier.pdf). Following it and the different notebooks should be necessary for reaching a  full understanding of the project.

The project consists of the following steps:
