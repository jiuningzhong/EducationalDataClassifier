Lots of people, plants, and animals need water from those rivers. And some scientists and engineers have worked together to use the energy from melting glaciers to generate electricity. But, we don't want them to melt too much. As more glacier water melts and flows to the ocean, the sea level gets higher, which can create a lot of problems. 5.Why can't we drink the ocean? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPyr0JrTmpo (Link->https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPyr0JrTmpo) The main thing your kidneys do is to make urine, otherwise known as pee.

       "'The circulatory system of the lungfish is similer to most fish and maybe humans. It\\'s heart does the same thing that the humans do but it goes to the gills of the fish. Plus each and every lungfish has different blood volume and preasure. (Of the small number of species of fish used in studies of the circulation, only a few have been investigated extensively. These include hagfish, dogfish, skate, ratfish, Port Jackson shark, trout, salmon, carp, tench, cod, lingcod, eel, and lungfish. The data have been collected using a variety of techniques under a variety of conditions. In some instances, the fish were not intact and were either out of water, restrained, or anesthetized; in other experiments the recordings were obtained from intact, unanesthetized, and relatively unrestrained fish. The circulatory system is of necessity, very responsive to changes in the environment,) the credits are from https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1546509808601296 (Link->https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1546509808601296) And I also used google scholar to find this info...\"'"
