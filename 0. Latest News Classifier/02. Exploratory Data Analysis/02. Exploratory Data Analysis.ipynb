Lots of people, plants, and animals need water from those rivers. And some scientists and engineers have worked together to use the energy from melting glaciers to generate electricity. But, we don't want them to melt too much. As more glacier water melts and flows to the ocean, the sea level gets higher, which can create a lot of problems. 5.Why can't we drink the ocean? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPyr0JrTmpo (Link->https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPyr0JrTmpo) The main thing your kidneys do is to make urine, otherwise known as pee.

Plus each and every lungfish has different blood volume and preasure. (Of the small number of species of fish used in studies of the circulation, only a few have been investigated extensively. These include hagfish, dogfish, skate, ratfish, Port Jackson shark, trout, salmon, carp, tench, cod, lingcod, eel, and lungfish.
